Name the program charchain.cpp. Make sure the following requirements are met. 

    - Program must compile and run.
    - Create an ADT character string as a class 
      (LinkedChar is name I am using) that uses 
      a linked list of each character
    - The LinkedChar class minimally has the methods  
      in the UML diagram below. You can add more methods.
    - Main function will have a menu of options.
        -- Enter new string and store as linked list 
          of characters in an ADT LinkedChar class
        -- Get current length (number of characters stored) from LinkedChar 
        -- Append a LinkedChar to another LinkedChar 
        -- Find index of character in a LinkedChar 
        -- Test if a LinkedChar is substring of another LinkedChar 
        -- Quit
